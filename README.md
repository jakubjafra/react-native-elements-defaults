react-native-elements-defaults
==============================

Small theming library that provides easy to set defaults for `react-native-elements` lib - without performance penalty for doing so.

# Problems

### No default styling

You can style `react-native-elements`' components for your app - but you can't style them *once for the whole app* - you can't override `Text` component used in other components by `react-native-elements`, right? Well, turns out - you can.
